@database-defaults
Feature: Search for a page
  As an author
  I want to search for a page in the CMS
  So that I can efficiently navigate nested content structures

  @javascript
  Scenario: I can search for a page by its title
    Given I am logged in with "ADMIN" permissions
    And I go to "/admin/pages"
    Then I should see "About Us" in CMS Tree
    And I should see "Contact Us" in CMS Tree

    When I expand the "Filter" CMS Panel
    And I fill in "Content" with "About Us"
    And I press the "Apply Filter" button
    Then I should see "About Us" in CMS Tree
    But I should not see "Contact Us" in CMS Tree
