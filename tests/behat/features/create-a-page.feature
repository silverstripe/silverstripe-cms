@database-defaults
Feature: Create a page
  As an author
  I want to create a page in the CMS
  So that I can grow my website

  @javascript
  Scenario: I can create a page from the pages section
    Given I am logged in with "ADMIN" permissions
    And I go to "/admin/pages"
    And I should see a "Add new" button in CMS Content Toolbar
    When I press the "Add new" button
    And I check "Page"
    And I press the "Create" button
    Then I should see an edit page form
