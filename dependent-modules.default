# File format
# -----------
# Each line represents one dependent module.
#
# local_module_folder[:git_branch|:svn_revision_number] repository_url [run_dev_build=true] [local]
#
# Note that the local_module_folder can contain subfolders delimited via '/' characters
# A specific git branch or SVN revision can be added in by specifying after the local
# foldername, separated by a colon. By default, the 'master' branch of a git repository is used. 
#
# It is recommended to have sqlite3 and cms first with [run_dev_build] set to "false".
# Having this set to 'false' prevents the execution of the dev/build process, meaning it can be
# deferred until all dependencies are in place, specifically the sapphire module. List
# all additional modules after that. 
#
# Examples
#
# frontend-editing:development git://github.com/nyeholt/silverstripe-frontend-editing.git
# themes/mytheme git://local.server/themes/mytheme.git false
